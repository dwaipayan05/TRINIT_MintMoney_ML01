# Nerdo : A Pandemic Bot

## Team Name

## Problem Statement Brief

During this pandemic, the healthcare industry has developed rapidly in order to combat covid in the best way possible. One can have several questions regarding Covid-19 and one's health which should be addressed quickly. However, doctors and healthcare workers have been working on the frontline, due to which, they cannot answer these questions for everyone. In order to tackle the problem, you have to design a chatbot that will answer all people's questions related to Covid-19.

## Solution Approach

**Nerdo : A Pandemic Bot**, Built for the Tri-NIT Hackathon' 2022. It built on Python and powered by Twilio Whatsapp API for carrying out conversations with the ChatBot. Considering the limited time constraints of the Hackathon, Nerdo is trained on a limited set of features. The features are listed below in brief
- *News Service* : Depending on a Single Word Query String, Nerdo will be able to serve you Top 5 Latest Headlines from over 80,000 News Sources related to COVID19, India, Health etc
- *COVID 19 Stats* : Nerdo will fetch the Stats for COVID-19 of a specific country or the complete world. The data fetched is updated every 5 minutes. (As of Now)
- *Chest X-Ray Detection* : Nerdo has used the help of his friend Xception to train a model on an Open Source Dataset of Chest X-Ray Images to carry out early stage detection of COVID-19. However, it's ill-advised against taking Nerdo's opinion as proper Medical Advice
- And then comes, *Nerdo*, our GPT3-Powered Chatbot. Nerdo is well acquainted with various academia related to COVID-19. He might be a bit whacky on certain questions since he was trained on an open source Knowledge Database which was curated through web scraping. However, Nerdo keeps track of conversations in a given session to give better replies.
